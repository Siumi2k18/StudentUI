The landing page is "login-page.php".
The user selects their name from the menu and enters their password.
This sends the form data to "login-attempt.php".
	If their password is correct, they are logged in, which is currently just a screen saying "Login Successful".
	If their password is incorrect, the screen says "Login Failed".
If the user doesn't have a password, they are redirected to "new-login.html".
Here they enter the teacher's password for verification and create a new password for their account.
This sends the form data to "new-login-attempt.php".
	If the teacher password is correct, and their passwords match, their entry in the database is updated with the new password.
	If the teacher password is incorrect, or their passwords don't match, an error screen is displayed.
